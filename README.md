üìä Hospital No-Show Analysis ‚Äì Summary Report
üöÄ Executive Overview

Analysis of 110,527 hospital appointments found a 20% no-show rate (~22,155 missed visits).
The strongest predictor is waiting time:

‚â§7 days ‚Üí 13.96% no-shows

>7 days ‚Üí 32.16% no-shows (2.3x higher risk)

This factor alone drives the majority of operational inefficiencies.

üîë Key Metrics

Overall No-Show Rate: 20.05%

Appointments Analyzed: 110,527

Estimated No-Shows: ~22,155

Optimal Model Threshold: 0.2 ‚Üí lowest operational cost at $25,760

‚è± Temporal Patterns

Monthly Trends: May (20.69%) highest, June (18.41%) lowest

Day of Week:

High Risk: Monday (20.53%), Friday (21.16%)

Lowest: Thursday (19.28%)

Weekend Effect: Saturday spikes to 23% (small sample size)

‚öôÔ∏è Operational Drivers
Waiting Time

Long waits (>7 days) double no-show likelihood.

Mondays & Fridays have the longest average waits (~9+ days).

SMS Reminders

65% effective overall

But weaker when wait times exceed 7 days (reminder effect fades).

üåç Geographical Risks

High Risk (>25% no-shows): SANTOS DUMONT, SANTA CEC√çLIA, ITARAR√â

Medium Risk (20-22%): CARATO√çRA, GURIGICA, ANDORINHAS

Low Risk (<15%): ILHA DO BOI, SOLON BORGES, M√ÅRIO CYPRESTE

üí∞ Cost-Benefit Findings

Threshold 0.2 ‚Üí Optimal ($25,760 total cost)

Lower threshold (0.1) increases false positives & costs (+35%).

Higher threshold (0.3) increases false negatives (+2% cost).

üéØ Strategic Recommendations

Reduce Waiting Times (Top Priority)

Offer urgent slots for high-risk patients.

Dynamic scheduling to keep waits <7 days.

Day-of-Week Resource Planning

More staff & reminder calls for Mondays/Fridays.

Explore Saturday alternatives.

Targeted Neighborhood Interventions

Focus on SANTOS DUMONT, SANTA CEC√çLIA, ITARAR√â.

Use double confirmations & community health workers.

Enhanced Reminder Strategy

Multi-touch (SMS + phone).

Initial reminder at booking, follow-up 2‚Äì3 days prior.

Tailored messages by neighborhood risk.

Predictive Model Deployment

Use 0.2 threshold for cost optimization.

Real-time risk scoring (waiting time, location, weekday).

Automated interventions for high-risk cases.

üìà Expected Outcomes

25‚Äì30% reduction in no-show rate.

$15,000‚Äì20,000 annual savings.

Better patient satisfaction & staff utilization.
